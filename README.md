# LEDR
Code and dataset for tackling location privacy-preserving edge demand response (LEDR) problem are presented here comprehensively and systematically.

## EDR-Dataset:
Here, we synthesize a new dataset named EDR based on the information from [AWS wavelength](https://aws.amazon.com/wavelength/features/), [Alibaba Cloud](https://github.com/alibaba/clusterdata), and a real-world dataset [EUA](https://github.com/swinedge/eua-dataset), including edge server capacities, edge server coverages, edge server and user locations within the Melbourne CBD area, server start-up and maintenance costs, etc

## GEES-Code:
The code of GEES is presented systematically. Different stages regarding the LEDR problem are simulated and modeled by respective functions.
